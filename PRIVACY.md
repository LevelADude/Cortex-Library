# Privacy Notice

Cortex Library is designed to keep reading activity on-device.

## What the app stores locally
- Source configuration and imported source definitions.
- Search history/cache and download state.
- Downloaded files and reading progress.
- Optional debug events used for troubleshooting.

## Network usage
The app connects to configured source endpoints to:
- Search for content.
- Fetch metadata and files (for example PDFs).
- Validate source connectivity.

The project itself does not operate a central tracking backend in this repository.

## Data sharing
- No user account is required by default.
- Data is not intentionally sold or shared by the app core.
- Content providers (remote sources) may log requests according to their own policies.

## User controls
Users can reduce retained data by clearing app storage, removing downloads, and disabling optional debug workflows.

## Third-party content
Cortex Library aggregates content from external providers. Provider terms, licensing, and privacy practices are controlled by those providers.
